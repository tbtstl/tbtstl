The following are ideas I believe to be true. Most are not mine.

### Truth is virtuous.

The pursuit of truth elevates human life beyond instinct or utility. To discover and act on what is real is both intrinsically meaningful and instrumentally powerful.

### Capital is a technology that scales truth-seeking.

Capital is a shared recognition system, encoding where we collectively believe value lies. Its existence requires intersubjective agreement. When deployed, capital extends an individual’s pursuit of truth and taps into a collective ledger of judgment. Capital can be wrong, but it is corrigible. Poorly deployed capital is always reallocated.

### Stewardship earns the right to direct capital.

Progression is best measured by how much capital can be consistently stewarded toward real discovery, not by seniority or tenure. The right to direct larger pools of resources comes only with demonstrated judgment. It is a responsibility earned through integrity and repeated proof.

### Measurement is provisional.

Measurements are useful only as temporary guides. They orient effort but are not truth itself. When mistaken for truth, measurement bends action toward the symbol rather than reality. The map becomes the territory, and the actual territory is lost. For this reason, measurements must expire, recalibrate, or be replaced.

### Experiment drives discovery.

Every experiment is a wager that something true will emerge. Each consumes capital and measurement as fuel. Failures recycle capital; successes refine direction and generate more. When many experiments run in parallel, their outcomes compound—reinforcing, contradicting, or triangulating one another. Collective experimentation produces leverage, accelerating discovery beyond what any individual could achieve alone.

### Culture is a checksum.

Culture counterbalances by reminding collectives of their higher orientation. A living culture corrects error, preserves vitality, and sustains discovery.

### Transparency builds trust.

Decisions must leave traces so others can learn, challenge, and extend them.

### Autonomy sustains joy.

When people are free to pursue problems that matter, their effort compounds. Autonomy creates energy.

### Institutions scale discovery.

Institutions exist to scale truth-seeking beyond individuals. Their value lies in how well they distribute capital, parallelize experiments, and preserve alignment with purpose. As with capital and culture, institutions must remain corrigible.
